## Life Changers

- [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) - This is by far the best virtualization software I've used. Sure, you can get VirtualBox for free and, well, VMWare probably has something, but I don't think either one can touch Parallels.
- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) - Learning to use a launcher is essential for getting things done efficiently and Alfred is one of the most powerful and polished.
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) - It bills itself as the missing package manager for OS X and it's true. It's the fastest way to get all the stuff Apple didn't provide and a LOT of other goodies, too.
- [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/) - Everyone has files and what you're not storing in a git repository should probably be backup up. Think of SpiderOak as Dropbox for power users. Power users that care about security.

## Mac Stuff

- [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) - This great little utility has one job: keep your Mac from going to sleep. It's awesome.
- [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) - This is one of those apps that you don't realize you need, but once you do you'll be pissed that you didn't think of it and there's no Windows equivalent (that I'm aware of).
- [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) - Forget the built-in Terminal app and install this well-loved bad boy.
- [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) - Adobe should be ashamed of itself for charging so much for Photoshop. Trust me, as a long time (PAID) user of Photoshop, I think Pixelmator is all most anyone will ever need. It's a LOT cheaper, too!
- [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) - Okay, paying for an FTP client seems silly when FileZilla does an amazing job for free. If you need to use an FTP client more than once a day, however, Transmit does have some really nice features and it looks great to boot.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - One beautiful thing about OS X is that you can run apps like Inkscape with no trouble at all. Forget Adobe Illustrator and fire this one up when you need to work with vector files.  Don't forget that Pixelmator has a vector mode, too!
