In [Stuart Kauffman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman)’s book, [At Home in the Universe](http://www.amazon.com/At-Home-Universe-Self-Organization-Complexity/dp/0195111303), he describes complexity and, in particular, a threshold of complexity that lends itself to software. Kauffman asks the reader to imagine a rug with 1,000 buttons spread out all over it. Our task is to join random buttons with thread and to keep going even if you pick up a button that already has a thread.

Initially you’ll have a few isolated pairs. As you keep going, eventually you’ll have fairly significant clusters. Around the 500th time you tie two buttons together, however, something incredible takes place and the buttons form a network. Rather than looking at 1,000 buttons on the rug, we’re suddenly faced with a new and significantly more complex system where tugging a single button may affect many buttons far away.

No matter where you stand on Kauffman’s ideas relating to self-organization, it’s not much of a leap to see similarities exist within the software realm. I can say that it’s no great leap because others have already made it. After all, self-organization guided by positive feedback is how neural networks learn complex patterns. Swarm robotics wouldn’t be as cool (or creepy) without it.

Of course, we start with nothing and form a small, ordered system. Often it doesn’t take long, however, before we witness the birth of a supercluster. Left unchecked, we’ll have a very nasty mess that breeches the reconstructive cost index before we know it. Perhaps that 50% metric is a useful threshold for software. I don’t know yet, but what is interesting to consider what we as programmers and architects have that is analogous to Kauffman’s button.
