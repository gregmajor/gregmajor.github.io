One of my many, many guilty pleasures is watching the [Crash Course series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse). John, Hank, and the whole crew do an incredible job of making the topics easy to understand, entertaining, and educational. What's more is that they do it all for free.

To support the effort they use [Subbable](https://subbable.com/) which is a creation of John and Hank Green and seeks to support creators. It's awesome! How does it work? Well, for a certain donation you can get a perk. What they are all depends on the creator, but in the case of Crash Course one of the many perks is the "Get Animated" one. For $150 you send them a picture and the animators at Thought Cafe will animate you and Crash Course will put that animation at the end of a Crash Course episode.

I've watched a LOT of Crash Course (and other works by the Green brothers) and I felt it was time to show some support. Naturally, I elected to be animated. It took me a long time to get them a picture, but I did and they knocked it out of the park! You can see my animation toward the end of the included video.

So check out Crash Course, Subbable, and all the good stuff that these guys have going on. If you feel inclined and have the means then throw a few bucks their way. I guarantee it's for a good cause and you'll feel better for having done it. Seriously. Like a LOT better.
